# What is the KOI Project? 
Koi symbolizes good luck and fortune in many cultures, and there is no shortage of koi to convey blessings and express noble status. In these unsettling times, the global epidemic still needs to be worked on by humans worldwide, and the motivation of the KOI Project from the beginning was precisely to share blessings and luck to everyone through the blockchain concept. 

As the project evolved, the concept of KOI Project gradually formed into a social creation experiment. You can see KOI Project as an art creation concept, NFT, blockchain game, or a meta-universe prototype.

# KOI Description. 
The basis of KOI Project consists of 30,000 koi, each KOI is unique and has its own unique pattern using ERC721 protocol. After casting, you can see the KOI pattern you own on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/koiproject), and you can also trade it on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/koiproject), the first 5,000 KOI are sold at 0.05 Matic. It doubles every 1000 after 5000.

# Example.
+ 5999~5001, each cost 0.1 Matic
+ 6999~6001, each cost 0.15 Matic
+ 7999~7001, each cost 0.2 Matic

The most expensive KOI only costs 1.35 Matic. We use a very low price because we want to make it easy for people to join the KOI Project.

Why is it not free? The entire KOI Universe releases 30,000 KOI's, and we want each KOI to be used as much as possible, so we charge a small fee to reduce waste.

Once all KOI's are released, you can only buy them on secondary markets like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/koiproject), but of course you can also make an offer directly on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/koiproject) for your favorite color.

You can Mint up to 20 KOI at a time, and each KOI will be born with a randomly generated gender, which will be needed in the future KOI universe.

Each KOI can produce 82 LuckyMoney per day at the beginning. LuckyMoney is the foundation of the KOI universe.

LuckyMoney is the basis of the KOI universe. LuckyMoney is a coin of ancient beliefs that can bring you luck, also known as fortune gold.

# LuckyMoney uses and restrictions.
Upgrade, each level requires: Level * 256 LuckyMoney
LuckyMoney can be used to write "secrets", each character needs to consume 1 LuckyMoney, UTF8 each character needs to consume 4 characters, only KOI all people can read "secrets", of course you can also write a love letter and send KOI to your most important person.
Every seven LuckyMoney can be exchanged for one Aura Coin (AURA), which can only be exchanged if the KOI is level 2 or above.
KOI can only have their own LuckyMoney, and cannot transfer money to each other.
LuckyMoney can be collected for all the KOI you have in the contract, but you can also collect them individually.

With each level of KOI or each additional transaction, the efficiency of producing LuckyMoney will increase.

LuckyMoney output: Basic daily output + level squared + number of times traded


# Aura Coins AURA Description. 

Once each KOI is upgraded to level 2, you can exchange LuckyMoney for AURA in one direction. The total amount of AURA issued is 30 million pieces, and once the exchange amount reaches 30 million, you can no longer exchange it and can only use the existing amount to circulate in the market.

The AURA in KOI can be transferred to other KOI, and can be packaged to become freely tradable Aura coins in the market, or can be saved back to the character.

AURA will continue to be used as the main currency in the KOI universe, including the prize pool, fish pond, spirit box and feed purchase, all need to consume AURA, related function upgrades or through the fish pond and KOI casting derived NFT, all need to consume feed and AURA.

In principle, the flow pool of AURA will be started after the completion of Fish Pool and Spirit Box, and every AURA used by users will be put into the flow pool, unless there is a demand in the market, and there is a chance to recruit AURA holders in advance to create the flow pool of DEX in the future.

# Airdrop Program. 

No, there is no airdrop program for KOI, and there is no Genesis mine for AURA, including the project team cannot get KOI for free or produce AURA in advance.

This is a game and a community creation, not a financial game. We hope KOI can bring a better side to the world, not a frenzied pursuit of money.


KOI and AURA are the first phase of this project, we will continue to improve the KOI-based cosmology, if you are interested in our project, here is the official contract.

Easy to operate interface is still under development, you can still interact through the contract first for casting, trading or collecting functions.
